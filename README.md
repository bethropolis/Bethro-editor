# Bethro-editor
 this is a text editor that also has a live viewer and it's fully made of front end languages like js, html and css wich are easy to edit

I have tried my best and I need help, the editor seems to be working fine but I did not have the time to add most of the funtionalities.

soon to add features

1. highlight.js
2. save funtion
3. line numbering
4. undo and redo 
5. autocomplete if I will be able
6. edit more files at the same time
7. create file...... oh, boy there are too many
